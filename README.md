# InsideParty

InsideParty is the ultimate backend library for clearnet services to provide BCH as an option to users!

## Inspiration

I wanted to provide an easy way for Python webdevs using Flask and other platforms (as such, these are common for microservices and serverless applications) and allow them to provide BCH as an option on top of other options they are providing through their payment provider.

## What it does

Integrates common BCH functions and exposes them as normal currency actions so integration is as painless as possible.

## How I built it

Built with Python!

## What's next for InsideParty

More integrations and useful features.
